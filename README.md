This repo will collect all basic BuzzFeed styling CSS.

It is implemented in SASS/SCSS.

The harp webserver is used to display and develop the styling locally:

<http://harpjs.com/>

> The static web server with built-in preprocessing.

> Harp serves Jade, Markdown, EJS, CoffeeScript, Sass, LESS and Stylus as HTML, CSS & JavaScriptâ€”no configuration necessary.
