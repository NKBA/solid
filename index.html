  <h2 class="bold xs-mb1">What is Solid?</h2>

  <p>Solid is BuzzFeed's CSS and component library. Influenced by frameworks like <a href="http://www.basscss.com/">Basscss</a>, Solid uses atomic CSS classes to both rapidly prototype and develop features, providing consistent styling options, but also the flexibility to create new layout and designs without the need to write more CSS. At the same time, a number of globally-resuable HTML and CSS components are available to help new apps spin up quickly without having to reinvent the wheel each time.</p>
